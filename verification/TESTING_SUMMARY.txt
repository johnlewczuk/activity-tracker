FRONTEND TESTS REQUIRING BROWSER VERIFICATION:
===============================================

Tests #1-18: Day/Week/Month View Functional Tests
- Implementation verified in code
- API data confirmed correct
- JavaScript rendering functions verified
- RECOMMENDATION: Run visual browser tests to confirm UI

Tests #23-31: Styling and Visual Tests
- CSS implementation matches mockup (code review)
- Color scheme correct
- Responsive design implemented
- RECOMMENDATION: Visual inspection in browser

TESTING METHODOLOGY:
====================

Backend API Testing:
- Direct curl requests to endpoints
- JSON response validation
- Edge case testing (future dates, no data)
- Response structure verification

Static Code Analysis:
- Complete read-through of all implementation files
- Function-by-function verification
- Edge case handling review
- Cross-reference with mockup requirements

CONFIDENCE LEVEL:
=================

Backend (Tests #19-21): 100% - Fully tested with live API
Edge Cases (Test #22): 100% - Backend tested, frontend code verified
Frontend Functional (Tests #1-18): 95% - Code verified, needs browser confirmation
Styling (Tests #23-31): 90% - CSS verified against mockup, needs visual check

RECOMMENDATION FOR NEXT SESSION:
=================================

Option A: Manual Browser Testing
1. User opens http://localhost:55555/analytics in browser
2. Manually verify each test #1-18 and #23-31
3. Take screenshots for documentation
4. Mark additional tests as passing

Option B: Automated Browser Testing (if tools available)
1. Use Playwright or similar to automate browser tests
2. Take screenshots at each step
3. Verify visual elements match mockup
4. Mark tests as passing with screenshot evidence

CURRENT STATUS:
===============
- 4 of 31 tests marked as PASSING (Backend APIs + Edge Cases)
- Remaining 27 tests: Implementation complete, awaiting browser verification
- No bugs found in code review
- Implementation is production-ready pending visual verification
