## 1. Implementation

- [ ] 1.1 Add focus state to timeline container element (tabindex, focus styles)

  - [ ] `-`/`+` or `[`/`]` for zoom out/in (when timeline focused)
  - [ ] `n` to center on "now" (current time, if viewing today)

- [ ] 1.3 Add visual focus ring/indicator when timeline has keyboard focus
- [ ] 1.4 Update the keyboard hints section to show new shortcuts
- [ ] 1.5 Ensure shortcuts don't conflict with existing navigation (`h`/`l` for month, arrow keys for day)
- [ ] 1.6 Test accessibility with screen reader announcements
